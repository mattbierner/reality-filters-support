# Reality Filters

[Reality Filters][app] is a novel augmented reality app for iPhone and iPad that lets you paint image filters onto the real world. Turn the world into a giant coloring book or selectively adjust the colors of your couch.

This documentation covers the basics of using Reality Filters. If you run into any issues or have any feature requests, you can also [file an issue][issues] here.

## Drawing

Reality Filters works best on devices that have a LiDAR sensor, such as the iPhone 12 Pro or iPad pro. However the app runs on all devices.

For devices with a LiDAR sensor, you can start drawing immediately after you launch the app. Touch on the screen to apply the current filter to that part of the world.

Note that you can only draw on surfaces that are under five meters away. The app also works best on solid surfaces. You generally cannot draw on water or glass.

Devices without a LiDAR sensor are limited to drawing on flat horizontal or vertical surfaces. After launching the app, you will see a preview of detected drawing surfaces. Try moving your device about the have it detect additional surfaces. Surface detection works best with good lighting on matte surfaces with some texture.

After confirming that the desired drawing surface is detected, press the checkmark to begin drawing.

## Effects
Reality Filters includes a number of build-in effects to select from. You can change the current effect by tapping on the sparkles icon and then tapping on the desired effect. 

Here's a list of the current filters:

- `Sketchy` — Renders the painted part of the world like it was sketched in pencil.

- `Coloring book` — Makes the world look like a pencil drawing. Paint on the world to fill in colors.

- `Monochrome` — Renders the painted part of the world grayscale.

- `Sepia` — Renders the painted part of the world in sepia.

- `Pleasantville` — Removes all color from the world. You can paint color back in.

- `Not Kansas` — Makes the world sepia toned. You can paint technicolor color back in.

- `Miami` — Renders the painted part of the world in teal and magenta.

- `Thermal` — Renders the painted part of the world teal and magenta.

- `Insta` — Renders the painted part of the world with a vintage style look.

- `Hue shift` — Adjust the color of the painted part of the world.
